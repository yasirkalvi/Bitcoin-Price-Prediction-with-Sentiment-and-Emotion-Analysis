# Bitcoin Price Prediction with Sentiment and Emotion Analysis


## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin price movements using sentiment and emotion analysis of Twitter data. The goal is to explore the relationship between Bitcoin's price changes and the sentiments expressed in related tweets.

The project consists of several Jupyter Notebook files that cover different aspects of the analysis.

## Files and Folders

## Files and Folders

- `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing tasks.
- `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
- `Emotion_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for emotion analysis on Twitter data.
- `Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the relationship between sentiment, emotion, and Bitcoin prices.
- `BTC_Dataset/`: Folder containing cryptocurrency price data.
- `senti-twitter-pred/`: Folder containing sentiment and emotion analysis data.
- `README.md`: This README file.
## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells in each notebook in the specified order to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
4. Customize the code and analysis according to your requirements.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the relationship between sentiment scores and Bitcoin price movements. The machine learning models in the `Modeling.ipynb` notebook can be used to make predictions about Bitcoin price changes based on sentiment analysis.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the desire to understand the impact of sentiment and emotion expressed on Twitter on Bitcoin's price. We thank the open-source community for providing valuable tools and datasets.
